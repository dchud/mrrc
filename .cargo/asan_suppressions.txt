# ASAN Suppressions for MRRC
#
# This file contains Address Sanitizer (ASAN) suppressions for known issues that are
# not actionable bugs in our code. Each suppression must document:
# - What is being suppressed and why
# - When it was discovered
# - Related issues or upstream references
# - Whether it's a temporary workaround or expected behavior

# Suppressions are empty initially, as the codebase has `unsafe_code = "forbid"` in
# Cargo.toml, preventing low-level memory bugs. This file exists as a placeholder for
# future findings in:
# - PyO3 bindings (src-python/)
# - Dependency-related issues
# - Platform-specific edge cases

# Format: One suppression per line following ASAN syntax
# Examples:
# leak:some_function_name
# race:data_race_pattern
#
